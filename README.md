This repository showcases a computer-vision solution for **industrial measurement tasks**.  
It contains code modules that:

- 📏 **Measure length and breadth** of objects in real time using camera images.
- 🔩 **Detect and classify threaded vs. non-threaded regions** (thread measurement) based on contour analysis.

The system is designed for use with **IDS industrial cameras** and demonstrates how to combine embedded systems knowledge with Python and OpenCV to achieve accurate, real-time measurement and inspection on production lines.

## 📝 Features
- Real-time image acquisition from IDS industrial cameras.
- Contour detection and dimension calculation (length & breadth).
- Thread detection and classification suitable for industrial quality control.
- Modular Python code that can be adapted to other microcontroller or camera platforms.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- IDS Peak SDK
- Embedded / Industrial camera integration

## ⚠️ Note
This repository contains only non-confidential code and examples to demonstrate my skills in embedded systems and image processing.
