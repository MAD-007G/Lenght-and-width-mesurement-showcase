# IDS Camera Image Processing – Training Project

This repository contains code that I personally wrote.  
It is my own work and is shared here as part of my learning portfolio.

## 📝 Overview
- Initializes an IDS industrial camera using the IDS Peak SDK.
- Captures real-time frames.
- Applies thresholding and contour detection with OpenCV.
- Highlights inner and outer contours and labels threaded/non-threaded regions.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- IDS Peak SDK

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated
- Real-time image acquisition from industrial hardware.
- Custom contour detection and classification.
- Embedded + vision pipeline integration.
